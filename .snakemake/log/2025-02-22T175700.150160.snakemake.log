RuleException in rule test_ccsnet in file /home/andy/anti_gravity/CCSNet/apps/tests/tests.smk, line 22:
NameError: The name 'test_segments' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:
set -x; touch /home/andy/sm.txt; echo {test_segments}
